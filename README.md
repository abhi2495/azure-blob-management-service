This application exposes REST APIs to perform the basic file operations (upload,download,delete,copy) 
in Azure Blob Storage Account.

The [**v12 azure sdk for java**](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/tree/master/sdk/storage/azure-storage-blob) is being used is here.
 
For integration testing, the storage emulator [**Azurite**](https://github.com/Azure/Azurite) has been leveraged.
